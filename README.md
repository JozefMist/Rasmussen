# Rasmussen
Script to calculate reduced alpha-decay widths.


Run with "python3 rasmussen.py" or "python3 rasmussen draw" for plotting.


Data are read from rasmussen_input.txt, each line for a separate calculation.


The order of input values:

  neutron number of the mother nucleus, 

  mass number of the mother nucleus, 

  alpha decay energy in MeV, 

  alpha decay energy uncertainty in MeV, 

  half-life of the mother nucleus in seconds, 

  half-life of the mother nucleus uncertainty in seconds, 

  alpha-decay branching ratio in %, 

  uncertainty of alpha-decay branching ratio in %, 

  relative intensity of alpha decay in %, 

  uncertainty in the relative intensity of alpha decay in %, 

  momentum change in the decay, 

  draw parameter (1 for drawing this decay)
